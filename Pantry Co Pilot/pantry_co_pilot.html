            Pantry Co-pilot is virtual inventory management app and website for starting out food truck owners and even
            ones who have been in the industry for awhile. This web application allows for users to manage their
            inventory in a easy, quick, and fun way to keep track of stock levels.
          </p>
          <div class="text-wrapper-5">The problem:</div>
          <p class="text-wrapper-6">
            For many food truck owners they often lack a formal inventory management system. Since storage is limited
            and the accessibility to purchase ingredients in bulk or receive a timely delivery has led to sporadic
            inventory tracking.

              Design a user-friendly Pantry Co-Pilot app and website that helps users manage food efficiently, reduce
              waste, and support their community by enabling food sharing and donations to local organizations.

            After conducting interviews with my local food trucks, I defined target persona Dylan (Food truck owner, 25)

          From speaking with local food truck owners in my city, many have highlighted that the biggest issue they have

          I first focused on the app format.  I created five distinct iterations of the homescreen, allowing me to
          thoroughly address user pain points. I prioritized the homescreen design since it serves as the main
          interaction hub, incorporating intuitive navigation buttons to enhance the user experience.<br /><br />I chose
          design A, since I wanted my homescreen to have a gamification element where the user can edit the layout of
          their ingredients to match exactly how it is placed in their inventory; creating a more unique personal touch.

          When focusing on creating the paper wireframe for the website, my main goal was to have a similar layout as

          page.
